## 🛠️ How to Run the Application

You can run the application in two ways:

### 🔧 First Method: Manual Setup & Running Locally

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ibrahim-Iradukunda/CodeTech.git
   ```
2. **Move into the project directory**
   ```bash
   cd CodeTech
   ```
3. **Install Node.js dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install --force
   ```
4. **Move into the backend folder**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```
5. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
6. **Return to the root folder and run the full stack (frontend & backend)**
   ```bash
   cd ..
   .\run-all.ps1
   ```
7. **Access the frontend, If you see a line like this in the terminal:**
   ```bash
   Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   ```
   **Click it or copy and paste it into your browser.**
8. **If the frontend does not open, run it manually:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
9. **Once you see this line, open it in the browser**
   ```bash
   Frontend: http://localhost:3000
   ```

### 🌐 Second Method: use the hosted version
